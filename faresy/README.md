# Fanbot Registration System

Bits and pieces needed to register FanBots and print their "passports":

* **master-node/** is the Node.js code running on the print & display master
* **slave-lcd/** is a utility to manage the LCD screen and touch sensor
* **slave-usbot/** is a modified fanbot.cpp version to read out FanBot info

Work in progress.
